# Alphabet Pyramid Code Challenge

This is a simple ruby implementation of a tail recursive to solve the alphabet pyramid code challenge. The program asks the user for a character of the english alphabet and will use the character to draw a pyramid whose sides are identified by the progression of the charcaters from A until the uppercase version of the user provided character.
 
e.g., Given e/E, it will draw:

```
        A
       B B
      C   C
     D     D
    E       E
     D     D
      C   C
       B B
        A
```
