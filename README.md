# Alphabet Pyramid Code Challenge

This is a simple ruby implementation of a tail recursive to solve the alphabet pyramid code challenge. The program asks the user for a character of the english alphabet and will use the character to draw a pyramid whose sides are identified by the progression of the charcaters from A until the uppercase version of the user provided character.
 
e.g., Given e/E, it will draw:

```
        A
       B B
      C   C
     D     D
    E       E
     D     D
      C   C
       B B
        A
```

Usage:

To run the program:

./go.sh 

./go.sh E

To run the test cases

./go.sh -t

To read the help text

./go.sh -h
